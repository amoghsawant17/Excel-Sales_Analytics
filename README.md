## Things that I learned from this Project
- [x] I studied and implemented the ETL methodology (Extract, Transform, Load) using Power Query to easily connect, and import data from various sources into Excel. This includes cleaning, and transforming data to make it suitable for analysis.
- [x] I created dynamic pivot tables for summarizing and analyzing large sets of data. This skill includes sorting, filtering, and displaying data in a visually insightful manner.
- [x] I learned DAX, to create custom formulas for advanced calculations, measures, and metrics within Power Pivot. DAX enables complex analysis and enhances the functionality of the data model.
- [x] I gained skill in enriching an existing data model by incorporating supplementary data, either from Excel or external sources, establishing relationships to provide a more comprehensive view for analysis.
- [x]	I have tried to design empathetic user-centric reports for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- [x]	I tried to adapt to evolving project requirements and changing data landscapes.
